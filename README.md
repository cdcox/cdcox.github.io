### Project 1: Using Python and Brian2 spiking neural network code to model stress response in hippocampus.

Model output, as you can see, the simualted and real traces are similar. Also a decrease in DG frequencey leads to a decrease in EPSC frequency, and a decrease in SPW frequency, a pair of traits found to be linked in actual slices. This allowed us to strengthen the length between these two traits, both of which increase in esponse to stress.
